# LangChain: Agents

## Outline:

* Using built in LangChain tools: DuckDuckGo search and Wikipedia
* Defining your own tools

## Define your own tool

```python
from langchain.agents import tool

```python
@tool
def time(text: str) -> str:

    questions related to knowing todays date. \
    The input should always be an empty string, \
