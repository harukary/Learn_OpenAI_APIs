# Document Loading

## Note to students.
During periods of high load you may find the notebook unresponsive. It may appear to execute a cell, update the completion number in brackets [#] at the left of the cell but you may find the cell has not executed. This is particularly obvious on print statements when there is no output. If this happens, restart the kernel using the command under the Kernel tab.

## Retrieval augmented generation
 
In retrieval augmented generation (RAG), an LLM retrieves contextual documents from an external dataset as part of its execution. 

This is useful if we want to ask question about specific documents (e.g., our PDFs, a set of videos, etc). 

![overview.jpeg](overview.jpeg)


```python
#! pip install langchain
```


```python
import os
import openai
import sys
sys.path.append('../..')

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

openai.api_key  = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
```

## PDFs

Let's load a PDF [transcript](https://see.stanford.edu/materials/aimlcs229/transcripts/MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf) from Andrew Ng's famous CS229 course! These documents are the result of automated transcription so words and sentences are sometimes split unexpectedly.


```python
# The course will show the pip installs you would need to install packages on your own machine.
# These packages are already installed on this platform and should not be run again.
# ! pip install pypdf 
```


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
loader = PyPDFLoader("docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf")
pages = loader.load()
```

Each page is a `Document`.

A `Document` contains text (`page_content`) and `metadata`.


```python
len(pages)
```




    22




```python
page = pages[0]
```


```python
print(page.page_content[0:500])
```

    Instructor (Andrew Ng):  Okay. Good morning. Welcome to CS229, the machine 
    learning class. So what I wanna do today is ju st spend a little time going over the logistics 
    of the class, and then we'll start to  talk a bit about machine learning.  
    By way of introduction, my name's  Andrew Ng and I'll be instru ctor for this class. And so 
    I personally work in machine learning, and I' ve worked on it for about 15 years now, and 
    I actually think that machine learning i

    "Welcome to CS229 Machine Learning. Uh, some of you know that this is a class that's taught at Stanford for a long time. And this is often the class that, um, I most look forward to teaching each year because this is where we've helped, I think, several generations of Stanford students become experts in machine learning, got- built many of their products and services and startups that I'm sure, many of you or probably all of you are using, uh, uh, today. Um, so what I want to do today was spend s"
